        "Residual scrolling" occurs when seeking forward to the end of a playing track (scrolling right), resulting in the next track playing while the scroll is still occurring. Inertia (i.e. the momentum phase of the scroll) can cause scrolling, and hence seeking, to continue after the new track has begun playing. This is undesirable behavior. The scrolling should stop when the new track begins playing.
     
        To prevent residual scrolling, we need to take into account the following variables:
        - the time when the scroll session began
        - the time when the new track began playing
        - the time interval between this event and the last event

/*
    A helper class that keeps track of a "scroll session" that consists of a set of scroll events performed in rapid succession. The constraint is that, during any single scroll session, scrolling may only be performed in a single direction (left/right/up/down) ... any events with a different scroll direction will be ignored.
 
    This is useful in eliminating human error caused by inexact (diagonal) scrolling, i.e. most people cannot scroll exactly in one direction. They scroll mostly in one direction, but often also a little bit in a perpendicular direction. 
 
    For example, when scrolling left, the user may scroll a little bit up as well. The result of such a scroll should be a scroll up without scrolling left.
