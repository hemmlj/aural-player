/*
    Custom audio graph node that encapsulates all logic for variable playback rate.
 
    The node offers 2 variable rate modes:
 
    - Variable rate without pitch shift (i.e. playback rate is altered, without change in pitch)
    - Variable rate with pitch shift (i.e. both playback rate and pitch are altered simultaneously and in sync)
