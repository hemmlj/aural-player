#  What's New in Version 1.6.1


## **Toggling between playlist view tabs**

Users can now conveniently toggle between playlist view tabs (i.e. Tracks / Artists / Albums / Genres) with
2 new menu items under the ***Playlist*** menu, and through their associated keyboard shortcuts:

**Previous playlist view** - Shift + Cmd + [
**Next playlist view** - Shift + Cmd + ]

Note that these keyboard shortcuts are consistent with the standard macOS shortcuts for tab switching in various apps: Finder, Firefox, Chrome, etc.

## **Standard way to toggle between dialog tabs**

Also, there are now standard consistent keyboard shortcuts to toggle between tabs in various dialogs such as Preferences, the Detailed Track Info popover, the Effects Presets editor, etc.

**Previous tab** - Shift + Cmd + [
**Next tab** - Shift + Cmd + ]

These keyboard shortcuts are consistent with those used to switch playlist views.
