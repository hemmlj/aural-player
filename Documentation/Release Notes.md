#  What's New in Version 2.8.0

## Grouping playlists now remember sort order from last app launch

The hierarchical (or "grouping") playlist views, i.e. Artists, Albums, and Genres, will now remember their sort order from the previous app launch and reorder their tracks accordingly upon app startup.

## Reduced gap between tracks during playback

When a track is playing, Aural Player will predict which track might play next and prepare that track for playback ahead of time (open the file for reading). This will, in the most common cases, reduce track preparation time when that track is selected for playback, thus slightly reducing the gap of audble silence between tracks.

## Bug fix - Crash caused by playlist track removal

In some cases, removing tracks from the playlist caused a sudden crash. This issue has been fixed.
