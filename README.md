# Aural Player

![App demo](/Documentation/Demos/mainDemo.gif?raw=true "App demo")

### Update (Feb 18, 2021)

The very ambitious version 3.0 was in active development last year, but due to unforeseen personal circumstances, that part of the project has been put on hold since Oct 2020. The planned 3.0 release will be delayed.

Instead, I have worked to get Aural Player up and running on macOS Big Sur, and have been making refinements and enhancements to version 2.x.

## Overview

Aural Player is an audio player for macOS. Inspired by the classic Winamp player for Windows, it is designed to be easy to use and customizable, with support for a wide variety of popular audio formats and some sound tuning capabilities for audio enthusiasts.

#### Goals:
* To have a simple drag-drop-play player for the music collection on your local drives, that recognizes a wide variety of audio formats.
* To *allow* customization/configuration, but not to *require* it out of the box.
* To make sound tuning an integral part of the listening experience and to have it within quick and easy reach at all times.
* To have a decent macOS Winamp counterpart.

#### Limitations:
* Does not play protected content (e.g. Apple's M4P or Audible's AAX).
* Does not integrate with online services for streaming / scrobbling, etc.

## Download

### Compatibility

**User**: macOS 10.12 (Sierra) or later versions.

**Developer**: Swift 5 and XCode 11.

Download the DMG image (containing the app bundle) from the latest release [here](https://github.com/maculateConception/aural-player/releases/latest).

[See all releases](https://github.com/maculateConception/aural-player/releases)

**NOTE** - The ffmpeg source code (and build script / instructions) for each release can be found in the Source code archive (zip / tar) for the release, under **aural-player-x.y.z/Resources/ffmpeg** (when extracted).

### Important note for macOS Big Sur

If you're on macOS Big Sur, you must download v2.3.0 or later versions. No older app versions will run on macOS Big Sur.

### Important note for anyone upgrading from v2.2.0 (or older) to v2.3.0 or newer app versions

In order to circumvent the hassle of macOS security restrictions, the location where the app stores its persisted state has changed from *~/Documents* to *~/Music*. This means that if you are upgrading from an older version of Aural Player (v2.2.0 or older), you need to move your app state directory from *~/Documents* to *~/Music* (exact steps listed below). Otherwise, note that you will lose all your previously saved app settings (playlist, sound settings, favorites, history, color schemes, window layouts, etc).

Perform the following simple steps when upgrading from v2.2.0 or any older version to v2.3.0 or any newer version.

* Quit Aural Player v2.2.0 (or any older app version) if it is running.
* Move the folder named ***aural*** in your user's *Documents* folder, to your user's *Music* folder.
* Download/install Aural Player v2.3.0 (or any newer app version) and run it.
* Verify that your previous app settings have been carried over to the new version - playlist tracks, window layouts, color schemes, history, favorites, bookmarks, etc. If not, please file an issue, and I will help you restore your previous app settings (this should not happen, but just in case).

The contents of the "aural" folder should look like this:

![aural app state folder screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maculateConception/aural-player/master/Documentation/Screenshots/auralDir2.png)

### Installation

1. Mount the **AuralPlayer-x.y.z.dmg** image file
2. From within the mounted image, copy **Aural.app** to your local drive (e.g. Applications folder)
3. Run the copy from your local drive. You will likely see a security warning and the app will not open because the app's developer is not recognized by macOS.
4. Go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Open anyway**, to allow Aural.app to open.

NOTE - Please ***don't*** run the app directly from within the image. It is a compressed image, and may result in the app behaving slowly and/or unpredictably. So, copy it outside and run the copy.

If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, try run the following in your terminal:
```shell
brew install --cask aural
```

### Enabling media keys support (optional)

![Enabling media keys support](/Documentation/Screenshots/EnablingMediaKeys.png?raw=true "Enabling media keys support")

1. Quit Aural Player if it is running.
2. Go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy**, and select **Accessibility** from the list of features.
3. Click on the lock icon in the bottom left corner, if it is shown as locked. Enter your macOS password to authenticate.
4. Click the + button and select **Aural.app** in the file browser that opens, to add Aural Player to the list of apps allowed to control your computer (See image above).

**NOTE**
* Media keys support is available from version 1.3.0 onwards.
* You will have to repeat this simple process whenever you upgrade to a new version of the app, because the macOS Accessibility permissions are tied to a single instance of the app.

## Known issues

### 1 - The text is too small on my high resolution Mac screen !!!

The fix for this is easy. 

#### On v2.5.0 or newer versions: 

Go to the menu **View > Font scheme > Customize**, and either increase the font sizes of the various UI textual elements, and/or choose different font faces, per your preference.

#### On v2.4.0 or older versions: 

Go to the menu **View > Text Size**, and choose the ***Larger*** or ***Largest*** text size preset, per your preference.

### 2 - Bad audio quality when connecting Bluetooth headphones

If you notice poor audio quality when you first connect Bluetooth headphones, try the following:

**Fix# 1 - Set your system's input device to the built-in device**

When you connect Bluetooth headphones to your Mac, if your headphones have a microphone, the OS will typically switch to using your Bluetooth microphone as its input device. Simply go to **System Preferences > Sound > Input**, and change the input device back to your Mac's built-in input device.

This should fix the problem. If not, try Fix# 2.

**Fix# 2 - Change your system's Bluetooth audio codec settings**
