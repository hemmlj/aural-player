## Overview

Aural Player is an audio player for macOS. Inspired by the classic Winamp player for Windows, it is designed to be to-the-point, easy to use, and customizable, with some sound tuning capabilities for audio enthusiasts.

#### Goals:
* To have a simple drag-drop-play player for the music collection on your local hard drive(s), that requires no configuration out of the box, although plenty of customization/configuration is possible.
* To make sound tuning an integral part of the listening experience and to have it within quick and easy reach at all times.
* To have a decent macOS alternative for Winamp.

## Documentation

All the documentation can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/maculateConception/aural-player/wiki).

[How To's](https://github.com/maculateConception/aural-player/wiki/How-To's)

NOTE - The documentation is incomplete and is a work in progress.

## Download

Download the DMG image (containing the app bundle) from the latest release [here](https://github.com/maculateConception/aural-player/releases/latest).

[See all releases](https://github.com/maculateConception/aural-player/releases)

**NOTE** - The ffmpeg source code (and build script / instructions) for each release can be found in the Source code archive (zip / tar) for the release, under **aural-player-x.y.z/Resources/ffmpeg** (when extracted).

### Installation

1. Mount the **AuralPlayer-x.y.z.dmg** image file
2. From within the mounted image, copy **Aural.app** to your local drive (e.g. Applications folder)
3. Run the copy from your local drive. You will likely see a security warning and the app will not open because the app's developer is not recognized by macOS.
4. Go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Open anyway**, to allow Aural.app to open.

If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, try run the following in your terminal:
```shell
brew install --cask aural
```

NOTE - Please ***don't*** run the app directly from within the image. It is a compressed image, and may result in the app behaving slowly and/or unpredictably. So, copy it outside and run the copy.

### Granting access on macOS 10.15 Catalina

![Catalina security prompt screenshot](/Documentation/Screenshots/catalina-access-prompt.png?raw=true)

Aural Player uses the **Documents** user folder to store persisted application state, logs, and transcoder output files. In other words, Aural Player needs access to the Documents directory to function.

Due to increased security on macOS Catalina, you will need to grant Aural.app access to your Documents folder. Please perform this step once by going to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Files and Folders**, and adding Aural.app with permission to access your Documents folder.

NOTE - Future versions of Aural Player may make the app storage location configurable, to circumvent this security restriction, but for now, this step is necessary for the app to function on macOS Catalina.

### Compatibility

**User**: macOS 10.12 (Sierra) or later versions

**Developer**: Swift 5 and XCode 11.

### Enabling media keys support (optional)

![Enabling media keys support](/Documentation/Screenshots/EnablingMediaKeys.png?raw=true "Enabling media keys support")

1. Quit Aural Player if it is running.
2. Go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy**, and select **Accessibility** from the list of features.
3. Click on the lock icon in the bottom left corner, if it is shown as locked. Enter your macOS password to authenticate.
4. Click the + button and select **Aural.app** in the file browser that opens, to add Aural Player to the list of apps allowed to control your computer (See image above).

**NOTE**
* Media keys support is available from version 1.3.0 onwards.
* You will have to repeat this simple process whenever you upgrade to a new version of the app, because the macOS Accessibility permissions are tied to a single instance of the app.

## Known issues

### Bad audio quality when using Bluetooth headphones

If you notice poor audio quality when using Bluetooth headphones, try the following:

**Fix# 1 - Set your system's input device to the built-in device**

When you connect Bluetooth headphones to your Mac, if your headphones have a microphone, the OS will typically switch to using your Bluetooth microphone as its input device. Simply go to **System Preferences > Sound > Input**, and change the input device back to your Mac's built-in input device.

This should fix the problem. If not, try Fix# 2.

**Fix# 2 - Change your system's Bluetooth audio codec settings**
