## Overview

Aural Player is an audio player for macOS. Inspired by the classic Winamp player for Windows, it is designed to be to-the-point, easy to use, and customizable, with some sound tuning capabilities for audio enthusiasts.

#### Goals:
* To have a simple drag-drop-play player for the music collection on your local hard drive(s), that requires no configuration out of the box, although plenty of customization/configuration is possible.
* To have a decent macOS alternative for Winamp.

#### What it is not (at the moment):
* A streaming audio player that connects to internet radio stations/services
* A scrobbler

## Download

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/maculateConception/aural-player/releases/latest).

[See all releases](https://github.com/maculateConception/aural-player/releases)

### Installation

1. Mount the *AuralPlayer-x.y.z.dmg* image file
2. Copy *Aural.app* to your local drive (e.g. Applications folder)
3. Run the copy from your local drive. You will likely see a security warning and the app will not open because the app's developer is not recognized by macOS.
4. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Open anyway, to allow Aural.app to open.

NOTE - Please ***don't*** run the app directly from within the image. It is a compressed image, and may result in the app behaving slowly and/or unpredictably. So, copy it outside and run the copy.

### Enabling media keys support (available with version 1.3.0 onwards)

3. Click on the lock icon in the bottom left corner, if it is shown as locked. Enter your macOS password to authenticate.
